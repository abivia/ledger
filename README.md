Tests: ![php 8.0](https://github.com/abivia/ledger/actions/workflows/php80.yml/badge.svg) ![php 8.1](https://github.com/abivia/ledger/actions/workflows/php81.yml/badge.svg)

Ledger lets you track anything related to money in your application with a
single package while making your CFO happy at the same time. No matter if
your app is handling memberships for a small club or supporting a multinational
enterprise, Ledger can handle it.

Ledger is a full-featured implementation of the core of any good accounting system, a double-entry
journal and general ledger. It is not a complete accounting solution, but rather the minimum for
keeping track of financial transactions. Ledger features a JSON API that provides access to all
functions.

That's the only minimal part. Ledger features:

- Full double-entry accounting system with audit trail capability.
- Multi-currency support.
- Support for multiple business units.
- Sub-journal support.
- Multilingual.
- Integrates via direct controller access or through JSON API.
- Atomic transactions with concurrent update blocking.
- Reference system supports soft linking to other ERP components.
- Designed for Laravel from the ground up.
